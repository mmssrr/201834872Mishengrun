keith keith allan schneider subject universe black hole wa year salem bruce salem write zeno paradox zeno paradox resolve show integration infinite series decrease term sum finite result nothing get black hole escape velocity speed light know time dialation prevent matter spiral get event horizon one explain matter get well suppose probe emit radiation constant frequency wa send towards black hole get closer event horizon red shift would keep increase period would get longer longer would never stop observer would observe probe actually reach event horizon detect energy probe would keep decrease would vanish exp never quite reach zero guess probably doe make thing clear hopefully get general idea maybe keith
